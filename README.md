# Carbon Pathways Animation

An interactive visualization tool that demonstrates the movement of carbon molecules through metabolic pathways. This project uses D3.js to create animated pathways showing molecular transitions in biological systems.

## Overview

The Carbon Pathways Animation visualizes how carbon molecules move through different metabolic pathways, making complex biological processes more understandable through interactive animation. The visualization includes:

- Animated carbon molecules moving along defined pathways
- Interactive controls for starting, pausing, and stopping the animation
- Visual representation of significant points in the metabolic process
- Information panel explaining the visualization
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**
  - Start Animation: Begin the pathway visualization
  - Pause Animation: Freeze molecules in their current positions
  - Stop Animation: Reset the animation
  
- **Visual Elements**
  - Blue Spheres: Represent carbon molecules
  - Light Blue dots: Represent significant points in the pathway
  - Grey paths: Show the routes molecules follow
  - Information tooltip: Provides context about the animation

## Technologies Used

- D3.js for data visualization and animation
- HTML5/CSS3 for structure and styling
- JavaScript for interactive functionality
- CSV data integration for pathway information

## Usage

1. Open the webpage: https://1ghernandez.github.io/Carbon_Pathway_Animation/ 
2. Click "Start Animation" to begin the visualization
3. Use "Pause" to freeze the animation at any point
4. Use "Stop" to reset the animation
5. Hover over the info icon (â“˜) for more information about the visualization
